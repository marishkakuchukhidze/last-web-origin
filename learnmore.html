                                            <h1>What is Front-End Development?</h1>
                                            <p>Front-end development, also known as client-side development is the
                                                element of the website
                                                that a user can see or interact with. This element gives one’s website
                                                or application visual
                                                functionality.

                                                For example, if you plan on making a website for your business some
                                                photos and content will
                                                not make up your website. You will need to give them selection criteria,
                                                a track for the
                                                client’s info, your location, contact details, etc.
                                                Front-end development is what makes these functions appear to the user
                                                on the application.
                                                Front-end developers work with various technologies, tools, and
                                                languages, including:

                                                HTML (HyperText Markup Language): The standard markup language used to
                                                create the structure and layout of web pages.
                                                CSS (Cascading Style Sheets): A stylesheet language used to control the
                                                presentation, formatting, and appearance of web pages, such as colors,
                                                fonts, and layout.
                                                JavaScript: A programming language that allows developers to add
                                                interactivity, animations, and other dynamic elements to websites and
                                                web applications.
                                                Front-end developers may also use libraries and frameworks, such as
                                                React, Angular, or Vue.js, to streamline their work and create more
                                                sophisticated and interactive UIs. Additionally, they often collaborate
                                                with back-end developers, who are responsible for the server-side logic
                                                and data management, to ensure seamless integration between the
                                                front-end and back-end components of a web application or website.
                                            </p>
                                        </div>


                                        <div id="back-end" class="Back-End">
                                            <h1>What is Back-End Development?</h1>
                                            <p>Backend Development, also known as server-side development is the element
                                                that is not visible to the clients. The core functionality of a back-end
                                                development lies in the fact of making the interaction of the user with
                                                the application smooth and hassle-free. In addition to this, it is
                                                responsible for maintaining and organizing databases and
                                                behind-the-scenes functionality of the front end as well.

                                                Suppose, coming on to your website many users fill out the contact form
                                                and make a purchase. In return, all they see is a front-end code of the
                                                successful transaction. But backend development is responsible for
                                                completing the purchase and storing the information in the database.
                                                For a dynamic and functional website, you need back-end development.

                                                Accordingly, some developers are proficient in not a single side of
                                                development and rather are interested in both sides (front-end and
                                                back-end) of working. These developers are called full-stack developers.
