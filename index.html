                            developing a simple single static page of plain text to complex web applications, electronic
                            businesses, and social network services. A more comprehensive list of tasks to which Web
                            development commonly refers, may include Web engineering, Web design, Web content
                            development, client liaison, client-side/server-side scripting, Web server and network
                            security configuration, and e-commerce development.</p>-->

                            design and of the fine arts. Its practice involves creativity, innovation and lateral
                            thinking using manual or digital tools, where it is usual to use text and graphics to
                            communicate visually.</p>-->

                            of a light-sensitive material such as photographic film. It is employed in many fields of
                            science, manufacturing (e.g., photolithography), and business, as well as its more direct
                            uses for art, film and video production, recreational purposes, hobby, and mass
                            communication.</p> -->
